Project Description: Diabetes Risk Prediction with Visual Insights
This project is a Streamlit-based web application designed to predict an individual's risk of diabetes using a machine learning model trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. The app allows users to input health metrics such as glucose level, BMI, insulin level, and more, and provides an easy-to-understand prediction (Low or High Risk of Diabetes).

Key features:

User-Friendly Interface: Input health metrics via a sidebar and view results instantly.
Interactive Visualizations: Dynamic plots, such as glucose level distributions and correlation heatmaps, give insights into the dataset.
Personalized Report: Generate and download a PDF report summarizing the user's inputs, risk prediction, and actionable health recommendations.
Advanced Filtering: Use sliders to filter data (e.g., by age range) and analyze trends.
This project combines data science, machine learning, and interactive visualizations to provide a robust tool for health assessment and awareness.
